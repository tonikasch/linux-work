         If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this
	 class, say Y and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	 <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	 Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly
	 affect the kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator
	 to skip all the questions about Davicom cards. If you say Y,
	 you will be asked for your specific card in the following
	 questions.
