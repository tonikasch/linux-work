* ARM Versatile Express Serial Configuration Controller device tree bindings

Latest ARM development boards implement a serial configuration interface (SCC)
that can be used to retrieve temperature sensors, energy/voltage/current
probes and oscillators values through the SYS configuration protocol defined
for versatile express motherboards.
It also provides a power management interface (serial power controller - SPC)
that is capable of managing power/voltage and operating points transitions,
wake-up IRQs and resume addresses for ARM multiprocessor testchips.

The SCC DT bindings are defined as follows:

- scc node

	- compatible:
		Usage: required
		Value type: <stringlist>
		Definition: must be
			    "arm,vexpress-scc,v2p-ca15_a7", "arm,vexpress-scc"
	- reg:
		Usage: required
		Value type: <prop-encode-array>
		Definition: A standard property that specifies the base address
			    and the size of the SCC address space
	- interrupts:
		Usage: required
		Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
		Definition:  SCC interrupt configuration. A standard property
			     that follows ePAPR interrupts specifications

Example:

scc: scc@7fff0000 {
	compatible = "arm,vexpress-scc,v2p-ca15_a7", "arm,vexpress-scc";
	reg = <0x7fff0000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <0 95 4>;
};
