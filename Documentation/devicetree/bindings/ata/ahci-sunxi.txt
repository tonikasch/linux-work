Allwinner SUNXI AHCI SATA Controller

SATA nodes are defined to describe on-chip Serial ATA controllers.
Each SATA controller should have its own node.

Required properties:
- compatible	: compatible list, contains "allwinner,sun4i-a10-ahci"
- reg		: <registers mapping>
- interrupts	: <interrupt mapping for AHCI IRQ>
- clocks	: clocks for ACHI
- clock-names	: clock names for AHCI

Optional properties:
- pwr-supply	: regulator to control the power supply GPIO

Example:
	ahci@01c18000 {
		compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-a10-ahci";
		reg = <0x01c18000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 56 1>;
		clocks = <&ahb_gates 25>, <&pll6 0>;
		clock-names = "ahb_sata", "pll6_sata";
		pwr-supply = <&reg_ahci_5v>;
	};
