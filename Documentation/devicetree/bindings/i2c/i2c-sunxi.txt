Allwinner SoC I2C controller

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "allwinner,sun4i-i2c".
- reg: Should contain register location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain interrupt.
- clocks : The parent clock feeding the I2C controller.

Recommended properties:
- clock-frequency : desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz.

Example:
i2c0: i2c@01c2ac00 {
	compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-i2c";
	reg = <0x01c2ac00 0x400>;
	interrupts = <7>;
	clocks = <&apb1_gates 0>;
	clock-frequency = <100000>;
};
